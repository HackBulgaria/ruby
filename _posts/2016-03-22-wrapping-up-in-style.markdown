Our humble Ruby and Ruby on Rails class is coming to an end. Don't worry, we'll
get out of this one with a bang! A big bang!

The final lecture will be on 30th of March and it will be given by no other
than [Bozhidar Batsov]. The man needs no introduction – an Emacs, Ruby and
Clojure legend. A lot of them people would have described him as zhelezarka!
They would have been totally right!

Don't miss it out! Tears, joy, alcohol – all that and more, in our FINAL
LECTURE!

Up until this point, we didn't really care about Ruby code style. While
it may seem superficial at first, not having to _learn_ how to read
every piece of Ruby code out there is a powerful thing.

If you follow the community set guidelines others will _know_ how to
read your code and vice versa.

Check out the [Community Ruby Style Guide] for the de-facto Ruby style
guide.
